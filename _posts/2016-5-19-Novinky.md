<p>Once Upon a Time Renewed for Season 6 <br>

Just days before launching the back half of Season 5, ABC’s Once Upon a Time has scored a renewal for Season 6.<br>
Series co-creator Adam Horowitz, as he did last year, announced the pick-up news via Twitter on Thursday afternoon:<br>
Thrilled to announce that #OnceUponATime has been picked up for season 6! Thank you ABC and thank you to the most extraordinary fans ever! (8:37 PM - 3 Mar 2016)<br>
TVLine’s hand-carved Renewal Scorecard has thusly been updated.<br>
Interestingly, the early renewal announcement comes barely two weeks after ABC shook up its upper management, replacing entertainment chief Paul Lee with Channing Dungey.<br>
Season-to-date, the fantastical drama series — which starting Sunday is heading to the Underworld — is averaging 5 million weekly viewers and a 1.6 demo rating, down about 25 percent from its Season 4 cycle. With Live+7 DVR playback, those numbers grow to 7.3 mil/2.6, ranking sixth and fifth among ABC’s dramas.<br>
As scooped this week by TVLine, Once is currently casting the recurring roles of two sparring brothers, to debut at season’s end and continue on into Season 6.</p>
